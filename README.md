## CryptoClustering

This program uses K-means algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA) to organize different cryptocurrencies by price change over periods of time. The periods of time are price change percentage in 24 hours after, 7 days after, 14 days after, 30 days after, 60 days after, 200 days after, and a year after. The modelling helps to determine which time periods are most influential for each cryptocurrency.
